Report:

In this data set, we can see that we are looking at 15 schools with over 39 thousand students. The top five performing schools are all charter schools and the bottom five are all district schools. When we look at the data by spending range, we see that schools that are performing better on math, judged by both Average Math Score and % Passing Math have lower spending per student. When looking by school size. we see that Large schools do the worse in Math, Reading and Overall Passing Rate while the difference between Small and Medium schools is miniscule. Charter Schools have higher math and reading score thus contributing to a higher passing rate per subject and overall. 
Conclusion:
1.	Charter schools perform better than District Schools.
2.	Large schools( over 20,000 students) preform worse than Schools with smaller student population.
